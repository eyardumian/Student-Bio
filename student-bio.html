				<p> I was born and raised in Orange County. I aquired a BS in Human Services from Cal State Fullerton, a teaching credential, and then spent the next 10 years teaching at the elementary level. Teaching in Orange County has been an unstable field for many years, so I have decided to transition to web development. I am very excited about my new venture!</p>

				<p> When I am not working, I enjoy spending time with my family outdoors. Some of my favorite things include traveling, learning to code, hiking, and sushi.</p>
